# Assembly-Programs
This is a repository dedicated to assembly programs written for the MC68000 Processor at school. 
All the assignments that were given are in the Assignment folder while all the labs experiments are in the labs folder.
The proofs are screenshots of the code running on the Motorola MC68000 Board during the labs.
